## What is Themify?

Themify is a small library that manages color themes using appearance
proxies. The ideia is to create a standardized, centralized and simple way to
create color themes that are applied to your app.

## What problem does it try to solve?

Creating color themes for an app is a boring task. You need to set color
properties over and over again, using storyboards or xib files. For large apps,
changing your color theme is hard and a no-brainer task.

Themify try to centralize it by using definitions stored in files or hard-coded
in your code. So, you can change the entire look of your app from a central
point, without having to edit any interface files anymore.
